# Lonliest-Place-on-Earth

Finding the point on Earth furthest from the human population or in a more amusing tone ”The Loneliest Place on Earth” is a fascinating computational problem with applications in a number of fields such as ecology, conservation, and urban planning. Given a chosen global population density dataset in GeoTIFF format (with a resolution of 30 arc-seconds or approximately 1km at the equator), I explored multiple approaches to identify the most isolated location with varying degrees of results.

The initial solution employed an antipodal approach, calculating the weighted centroid of the global population using K-means and identifying its antipodal point as the most remote location. While computationally efficient, this method oversimplifies population distribution. I then developed a Voronoi diagram-based solution, which divides the Earth’s surface into regions based on proximity to populated areas. The vertices of these Voronoi polygons represent equidistant points from multiple population centres, making them candidates for remote locations. To handle the computational challenges of global-scale data, methods to down-sample the data were implemented. However, this approach still proved to be a challenge to get computationally efficient.

Additionally, a Binary Masking approach to calculate the furthest distance from any human population using a distance transform was used that provided the most reasonably accurate result giving us a location approximately in Antarctica.
Each method presented trade-offs between accuracy, computational ef- efficiency, and memory usage. The Binary Masking approach offered a good balance, providing reasonably accurate results while remaining computation- ally feasible. Key challenges included handling the large dataset, ensuring accurate land/water discrimination, and managing computational resources effectively.
